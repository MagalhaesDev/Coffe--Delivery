### 2 - Cart 

* This cart component has the intention of storing the selected items and their quantity, all this integration is done with a communication from the client with the server where the search for the selected items and their stock is done, having several rules to be applied,  as the quantity not being greater than the stock, if the item really exists, among others.

### 3 - React toastify

* We used the toastify react to display error messages to the user when some rule did not occur as expected. In this example below we see a message when the user tries to place more items than are in stock.
